# Movie Rating Prediction and Recommendation Models
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that builds predictive models and recommendation systems for movies using two different datasets. The notebook demonstrates multiple machine learning approaches, including **Linear Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **K-Means Clustering** to predict movie ratings and recommend similar movies.
